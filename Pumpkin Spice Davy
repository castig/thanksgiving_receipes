Pumpkin Spice Creme Brulee

Heat the half and half with a bit of cream in a saucepan.
Stir in the pureed pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and a few extra spices until smooth.
Whisk in the eggs and sugar.
Cook until beginning to thicken. 
Arrange the ramekins on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
Divide the cream mixture evenly among the ramekins.
Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the ramekins. 
Bake for 50 minutes or until set.
Cool to room temperature then refrigerate.
Sprinkle the custard with the sugar and melt with a kitchen torch until caramelized.
