Ingredients
1 whole unbaked pie crust
1 c. white sugar
3 tbsp. brown sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. corn syrup
3/4 tsp. vanilla
1/3 c. melted butter (salted)
3 whole eggs, beaten
1 c. (heaping) chopped pecans

Directions
1) First, whip up your pie crust using Sylvia's Perfect Pie Crust.
2) Preheat the oven to 350Ëš. Next, mix the sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl. 
3) Pour the chopped pecans in the bottom of the unbaked pie shell. 
4) Pour the syrup mixture over the top. Cover top and crust lightly/gently with foil. Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. Note: Pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven! If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake for an additional 20 minute or until set. Required baking time seems to vary widely with this recipe. Sometimes it takes 50 minutes; sometimes it takes 75!
5) Allow to cool for several hours or overnight. Serve in thin slivers.
