For this recipe, you'll make the pie dough, roll it out, place it in the pie tin, trim the edges, then freeze it. Freezing the crust helps keep it from slipping as the pie bakes. No need to pre-bake the pie crust before adding the filling.
I recommend our easy, flaky, sour cream pie crust.

Ingredients
1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust, frozen for at least 30 minutes (see recipe note)
2 cups (210g) pecans, coarsely chopped (save a few whole pecan halves to create a decoration on the surface of the pie, if you want)
3 large eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon molasses (unsulphured)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
