I JUST EDITED THIS
Go to best local pizzeria and buy dough
Turn on pizza oven to 1000F
Saute onions, so that they are carmelized
cook off some spicy sausage in a high pan
place cooked sausage, which is not hot on the rolled out pizza dough
place saute onions on top
place gorgonzola cheese on top
place in pizza oven for 2 mins
take out and drizzle with balsamic glaze
you. are. done
